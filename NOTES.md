I'll provide a comprehensive list of CSS properties specifically related to flexbox:
Flex Container Properties (applied to the parent element):

`display`: flex or display: inline-flex - Establishes a flex container
`flex-direction` - Defines the direction of flex items (row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse)
`flex-wrap` - Controls whether flex items wrap or stay on a single line
`justify-content` - Aligns flex items along the main axis
`align-items` - Aligns flex items along the cross axis
`align-content` - Aligns multiple lines of flex items when there's extra space in the cross axis

Flex Item Properties (applied to child elements):

`flex-grow` - Defines the ability for a flex item to grow
`flex-shrink` - Defines the ability for a flex item to shrink
`flex-basis` - Sets the initial main size of a flex item
`flex` - Shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis
`align-self` - Overrides the container's align-items property for individual flex items
`order` - Changes the order of flex items without modifying the source HTML

The flex shorthand is particularly useful:

flex: 1 is equivalent to flex: 1 1 0%
flex: auto is equivalent to flex: 1 1 auto
flex: none is equivalent to flex: 0 0 auto

These properties give you complete control over the layout and behavior of flex containers and their child elements, allowing for incredibly flexible and responsive designs.
